This website is built to caluculate the users tax rate for the year on various incomes in Australia
There are three input asking for user incomes for the year namely
Personal income: income earned as salary and wages
Sole trader: income from contract work as a solo operator of the business
Business income: income through business activities
Each income has it's own tax rate and brackets
input is processed in python and flask and the final tax they have to pay will be the output of the program
i have also created a database in order to store all the searches that's been made on the website and display them on the homepage after the user
has entered his input..

I have used bootstrap to design the responsive elements in the design  and couldn't design the header as i tried to do it on my pc and failed to use natice command line
as i am still getting used to programming on my pc

I have designed this website as a result of having difficulties finding a websites
that shows the same output without asking to sign up for the website
i am planning and further develope the website and launch it for the public to use for free and no marketing is done to them
